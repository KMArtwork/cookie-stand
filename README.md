Salmon Cookies project for Code Fellows, Code 201

## Cookie Stand
This is the infamous salmon cookies project where I demonstrate my ability to create and use objects via constructor functions and simulate multiple stores' sales data which is then displayed in a table. 

The user may also add a store to the sales data page if they wish by adding in the relevant information to the input fields.

Also included is a page that acts as a mock up of an online ordering system where you can add items to a cart and upon 'checkout' will take you to a page where you can fill out your customer information like your name, address, card, etc. None of the information is saved or used and is only meant to display the possible functionality.

This project was created over the course of a week, following the prompts from Code Fellows Code 201 class.
